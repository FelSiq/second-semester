To determine the beginning and the end of a token, the function first scans from the starting location for the first character not contained in 
delimiters (which becomes the beginning of the token). And then scans starting from this beginning of the token for the first character contained in 
delimiters, which becomes the end of the token. The scan also stops if the terminating null character is found.
